Whether I'm building a responsive website, analyzing data trends, or developing a scalable application, I strive to create solutions that are both powerful and meaningful. I thrive on the challenge of solving intricate problems and discovering new ways to push the boundaries of what’s possible.

    Crocheting and knitting are my go-to activities to relax after a long day, allowing me to unwind while working with my hands. I also play the guitar, which offers a fun and expressive outlet.
